#bank techtest

The aim of this tech test is to set up a simple application to handle the deposits and withdrawals of a sample user in a sample bank account.

The application is written in Ruby and completely tested with RSpec. There are no further dependencies, as data is not persistent and stored in memory rather than a database.

The functionality is therefore limited and likely not applicable in the real world. The development of this application, however, serves to illustrate principles of good and thorough software development and should be viewed with this in mind.
